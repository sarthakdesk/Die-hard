"Jesus Crisis" is an incremental "gacha" game with a dark, divine theme. Players take on the role of the last faithful nun in a world where Heaven has fallen silent after a cataclysmic battle with Satan. The core gameplay revolves around a cycle of prayer, collection, economic management, and strategic upgrades to amass power and restore faith.
Player Progression: Players gain XP for praying and winning fights, leveling up their character. Leveling up serves as a progression gate, with high-level challenges (like fighting Satan) requiring a minimum player level.
Combat System (Infernal Arena):
Satan's Goons: A low-risk, repeatable fight that provides a small but guaranteed gold reward.
Challenge Satan: A high-risk, high-reward boss battle. The chance to win is based on the player's total "Faith Power" (derived from statue levels). Winning yields a massive gold reward, but the fight is gated behind a high player level (Level 40) and has a cooldown.
Power-ups (Forbidden Altar): Players can find or earn consumable power-ups:
Divine Stimulant: Doubles all gold gains for a limited time.
Jackpot Potion: Makes all prayers free for a short, frantic period.
Random Events (Mythical Encounters): Players can "Explore the Wilds" to trigger random narrative events. These encounters offer choices that lead to rewards like free gold or valuable power-ups.
Thematic World: The game is wrapped in a compelling narrative of a fallen Heaven and a lone nun's quest. The gods (from Jesus to a "Chicken God") have distinct personalities and even tell jokes, adding flavor and humor to the dark premise.
Objective:
The ultimate goal for the player is to progress from a humble nun into a powerhouse of faith. They do this by strategically managing the artifact market, maximizing their income, and building up their pantheon of divine statues to become powerful enough to consistently defeat Satan and his minions, restoring hope to a world abandoned by the heavens.
